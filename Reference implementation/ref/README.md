# Rhyme

A lattice-based digital signature scheme from the paper "Rhyme: A Fiat-Shamir Lattice-based Signature with 3C Sampling".

This scheme is based on the Fiat-Shamir transform and introduces a new sampling method called "Convolution of Constant Counts Sampling (3C Sampling)" to prevent secret key leakage, avoiding the use of rejection sampling.

This repository contains the reference implementation for the Rhyme signature scheme.
